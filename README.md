## Bayesian N-Mixture Models Applied to Estimating Insect Abundance 

This repository contains all necessary files to carry out the analyses performed in Mimnagh et al., (2023). 

### Appendix Files
The following files form the appendix for this chapter
* Appendix_A.R provides R code to simulate data for, and fit the original N-mixture model (Royle, 2004).
* Appendix_B.R provides R code to simulate data for, and fit the multi-species N-mixture model model (Mimnagh et al., 2022).
* Appendix_C.R provides R code to produce the covariance diagnostic proposed by Dennis et al., (2015)

### Case Study Files
The following files pertain to the original N-mixture model (Royle,2004) and the MNM model (Mimnagh et al., 2022) fitted to data collected as part of the BeeWalk Survey Scheme  (Comont 2017, http://www.beewalk.org.uk) in the UK.
